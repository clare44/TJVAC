   <h1>Introduction: Why it is important to hav information</h1>
   <p>As the LGBTQ+ community comes more and more to the forefront of conversation, and more resources emerge for youth, increasing numbers of youth are choosing to come out.. It is becoming increasingly important that the trusted individual(s), that the youth has chosen to confide in, have the correct information and enough knowledge to be able to support them. It is also important with the rise of the internet, that youth are provided with correct information, in order to help them stay safe.

   <h1>General Information</h1>
   <p>Research done over the past 20 years has shown that sexual orientation develops early. No one knows why some people are gay or bisexual while others are heterosexual but people do know that no one can “make” someone gay. Unfortunately however, while no one can make a person gay including ones parents, most people are deeply affected by the acceptance of their parents or caregivers. The rejection or acceptance of the person’s sexuality or gender identity has been shown to greatly impact the person’s mental and in some cases physical well being. Rejection has been linked to increase in suicide in teens and to increases in the number of LGBQ+ teens who are homeless or in foster care. These factors then increase the risk of abuse and serious health and mental health issues. More indepth research findings can be found below.</p>

   <h1>Safety</h1>
   <p>It is important for young people to have accurate information concerning their safety when it comes to sexual activity and relationships. This is often difficult to come by as many school programs do not teach very in depth courses on health and sex-ed. To make matters worse those courses are not usually geared towards LGBTQ+ students which puts them at risk. 
    These are some websites that offer helpful information concerning sex, mental health, substance use, and the state of sexual education in schools:

   <h1>Advice For Parents</h1>
   <p>Parents want what is best for their kids but unfortunately that isn’t always easy, especially when you happen to be the parents of a child who is part of the LGBTQ+ community. LGBTQ+ youth face unique challenges and most parents in this day and age are still not fully equipped to handle them. It is important for parents to have some tools to help their child deal with these challenges which they have not necessarily had any experience with themselves. 
    One of the most important things is letting the child know that they are loved and that you support them. Without this support, the mental health of youth can quickly deteriorate and as their parents it is important to support them. 
    Another important thing is encouraging dialogue and making sure that they feel comfortable around you so that they can ask you for advice. This doesn’t necessarily mean that they will, and don’t try to force them, but it is always nice to have a trusted person supporting you. If they do choose to confide in you, encourage them and try to listen carefully and try to understand what they are trying to tell you. Ask for clarification if you’re not sure. 
    By far one of the most important things to do as a parent of an LGBTQ+ person is to learn the facts. Take time to educate yourself on the topic in order to be able to fully support your child. Without this information, there is more risk of misunderstanding and being unable to fully support your child in this important time in their life. Having some basic knowledge is helpful and there are a number of places online where you can find it. You should also ask your child what they want you to know about their identity and what they want you to understand in order to feel as though you are supporting them, this can be very important as things such as gender and sexuality are often not simple or set in stone, they won’t always fit a label. Also remember that these things can change over time as people grow and learn more about themselves. Try not to be too overbearing, let them tell you what they want you to know.
